// HEADER ONLY :)
// in this file I just wanted to defend my choice of using an AVL tree 
// over other data structures like hash maps or B-trees for implementing a sorted byte tree.
// I chose an AVL tree because it provides efficient O(log n) time complexity for insertion, deletion, and lookup operations,
// while maintaining a balanced structure. This balance ensures that the tree remains efficient even in the worst case 
// scenarios, unlike unbalanced binary search trees which can degrade to O(n) time complexity.
// Since I like to keep thigs fast I chose an AVL Tree

here is some shader code just because I like shaders :D
